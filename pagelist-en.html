     Mechanisms of Consciousness and Existence </a> </h3>

   <p> Consciousness originates from capacity for self-learning that
            is implemented to my cyber butterfly. Also I discuss origination
            of space and time. </p>

   <blockquote>
    <p> <a href="mind/consciousness-en.html">
      Mechanisms of Consciousness </a>
     Rapid adaptation needs capacity for prevision. The motive
                of the adaptation is biological vital needs of organism. </p>

    <p> <a href="mind/danger-en.html">
      Dangerously intelligent </a>
     Artificial
                conscious beings will develop exponentially because they don't
                need to study what is already known to their predecessors. </p>

    <p> <a href="mind/prove-en.html">
      Consciousness and Logic </a>
     No
                programmer could preview all future situations in the robot's
                life. </p>

    <p> <a href="world/space-en.html">
      Origination of space </a>
     My interest
                is the mechanism of existence in general. Existence of space,
                time and matter. Why and how existence is possible in principle? </p>

    <p> <a href="world/existence-en.html">
      Why is Existence Possible </a>
     It's a short explaining chain about initial reason of physical
                existence - from a self-supported object to our universe. </p>
