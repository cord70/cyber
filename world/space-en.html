    I look for constructive mechanism of physical
            existence in general - origination of space, time, matter and
            the universe on the whole. The theory is not physical, rather
            it's a philosophical discourse. </p>

   <h2> Origination of space </h2>

   <h4> (The program of constructive romanticism) </h4>

   <h4> <a title="author">
     Eugene Kornienko </a> </h4>

   <p> This article about mechanism of existence was written in 1990
            under my impression of achievements that modern physics does in
            studying of origination of the universe. </p>

   <p> A philosophical notion as
    <i> self-consistency of the universe </i> leads to a physical model of space and time. </p>

   <p> The self-consistency means that
    <i> existence of every object
                is supported by some conditions that are in the universe </i> . The universe is also an object, and it exists because there
            are needed conditions in the universe. </p>

   <p> Actually the claim equals the tautology:
    <i> nothing exists
                beyond all existing </i> . All existing objects relate to each
            other and all they on the whole are named
    <i> the universe </i> . </p>

   <p> There are other meanings of the notion "the universe".
            But let's speak not about words, but about the "all existing".
            This overall object may be called a
    <i> self-supported object </i> because "nothing exists beyond all existing". No
            "external" conditions are necessary for the object to
            exist. In other words, the cause and "explanation" of
            existence of a self-supported object is contained "within"
            the object, not in any other objects. So if our self-supported
            universe arises and exists, hence
    <i> other </i> self-supported
            objects must also arise and exist that is provided by their inner
            independent nature. </p>

   <p> As the universe as the "other" self-supported objects
            are not watchable "from outside" because they are strictly
            close and don't have the "outside". Particularly they
            cannot interact to other objects. Nevertheless such objects must
            arise because that arising doesn't need any conditions. It follows
            from the fact that our universe is also a self-supported object
            and it does exist. Also no existing conditions may interfere the
            arising because it's impossible to interact to a self-supported
            object. How may such arising affect to existing objects? </p>

   <p> Isolatedly arising self-supported objects aren't existing
            for other objects. Let's consider only such self-supported objects
            that are elements of
    <i> related set </i> of such objects. Logically
            a set of related elements is a space. It is not known what are
            these relations and how the space refers to the physical three-dimensional
            space. However all points of the space are somehow linked to all
            other points (and to the physical space) because isolated points
            don't belong to the "related set". </p>

   <p> Arising of a new point (an element of the set) within spatial
            continuum doesn't make any consequences because the point doesn't
            interact with other points. The only "geometrical" place,
            where such arising might change existing space, is the boundary
            of the space. </p>

   <p> Notice that every space may be considered as a sub-space in
            a greater space, say in a space of greater dimension. And if the
            encompassing space doesn't exist then every spatial point is the
            boundary point that is an initial point to increase the space. </p>

   <p> So the arising of self-supported objects may appear as
    <i> uncaused </i> increasing of local "volume" or number
            of dimensions of existing space with simultaneous forming of spatial
            mertic. But the new points cannot exist even here because they
            don't interact. They change geometry of the boundary, then they
            instantly vanish (for existing objects, not for themselves). </p>

   <p> Common sense objects but logic forces us to allow that "self-supported
            points" must arise, but they cannot exist. I want to show
            how and which uncaused change of space may follow from self-consistency
            of the universe. Don't panic, it's yet not our three-dimensional
            space! </p>

   <p> So the space, that might be made of the self-supported elements,
            vanishes (cannot exist) because its elements don't interact to
            each other. But its
    <i> self-interacting boundary </i> remains.
            The boundary is less ephemeral space because it has properties
            -
    <b> its dynamics depends on its current geometry </b> . </p>

   <p> I repeat that we consider some logical space that is only
            coming to exist. The space is almost not metrical, it's discontinuous
            in every point (rugous, looks like a fractal) and it doesn't possess
            properties like "velocity of propagation of disturbances".
            But the disturbances are. With they aren't weak but strong ones:
    <i> the uncaused changes of local geometry </i> . There is no
            mathematics to describe the process; and maybe it's impossible.
            But there are logical means for making of physical model. Firstly
            we see that by origin the space is absolutely statistically symmetrical. </p>

   <p> Propagation of perturbations along the space smoothes initial
    <i> chaos </i> and somehow forms the symmetrical physical world.
            The perturbations themselves are disturbances of general symmetry.
            Space-time and Particles may be treated as the most stable perturbations
            (solitons) among infinite variety of primary perturbations. Combinations
            of these most stable disturbances create whole hierarchy of material
            world. </p>

   <p> The physical space as well as quantum world inherit high symmetry
            of the primary space. Particularly they possess a property of
            recalibration because the initial space doesn't have a specific
            scale. And natural stochasticity of the prime-dynamics leads to
            quantum uncertainty. </p>

   <p> In macroscopic world the quantum uncertainty is smoothed,
            too; and it seems that all things have their causes. </p>
