   <h2> Why is Existence Possible ? </h2>

   <p> Why does the Universe Exist ? </p>

   <h4> remarks: </h4>

   <ul> <li> There is no thing beyond existing things. </li>
    <li> "What is existence" is a philosophical question. </li>
    <li> "Which forms of existence are possible" is a scientific
                question. </li>
    <li> "Does some object exist" is a subjective question. </li>
    <li> Existence is only possible in time and in appropriate space. </li>
    <li> "What are time and space" is a scientific question. </li> </ul>
   <h4> definition: </h4>

   <p> <i> The Universe </i> is all existing. </p>

   <p> <i> The Cause </i> is what supports (ensures) the existence
            of the object. </p>

   <h4> remarks: </h4>

   <ul> <li> The Universe exists. </li>
    <li> An object is what may be discussed. </li>
    <li> A cause is also an object. </li>
    <li> Every object has or has not a cause. </li>
    <li> If an object has a cause then the cause exists. </li>
    <li> The cause exists within the universe. </li> </ul>
   <h4> definition: </h4>

   <p> <i> Self-supported object </i> is an object that doesn't have
            a cause. </p>

   <h4> consequences: </h4>

   <ul> <li> Self-supported object is absolutely independent on other
                objects. </li>
    <li> Self-supported objects are unmanifested. </li>
    <li> Self-supported objects exist because the universe does exist
                and it is self-supported, too. </li>
    <li> A self-supported object contains self-supported objects.
                It is contained, too. </li>
    <li> The hierarchy of causes starts from self-supported object
                that doesn't have a cause. </li> </ul>
