   <h2> Mechanisms of Consciousness and Existence </h2>

   <p id="top">
    How do intellect and emotions work technically? Is it possible
            to explain the origin of physical space, time and nature? Today's
            science is close to resolution of the challenges! </p>

    If an entity feels well, its needs are satisfied,
            the state of its organism is normal, then it is able to memorize
            well what it senses and how it behaves. The very this is learning. </p>

   <h3> Nature of consciousness </h3>

   <ul> <li> <a href="mind/consciousness-en.html" title="How did feeling and
      awareness emerge in nature">
      Mechanism of Consciousness </a>
     <br> What is mind and how can we create it? Main problem of self-learning
                is that the learning entity doesn't know what is it awarded or
                punished for. I suppose that biologically the problem is solved
                so. If an entity feels well, all its needs are satisfied, the
                state of its organism is normal, then it is able to memorize well
                what it senses and how it behaves. If the state of organism is
                getting worst then the ability to memorize is weaker. That is
                why conscious entity better memorizes the behavior, which leads
                to normal state of its organism. </li> </ul>
   <ul> <li> <a href="mind/danger-en.html">
      Dangerously Intelligent </a>
     <br> What do you think about a conscious tank? Not every designer
                wishes trace carefully his creature. Often the designer intentionally
                gives a freedom for, say, a computer virus. Generally, there are
                many things, we create, which are not fully controlled in principle.
                Our children, for instance, are. AI is the second example. </li> </ul>
   <ul> <li> <a href="mind/prove-en.html">
      Consciousness and logic </a>
     <br> Is it possible to check possessing of feelings? Material
                and ideal processes are not intersecting, nor reducing to each
                other. So
     <i> the objective </i> test on consciousness is impossible.
                In a better case indirect measurements may show some plausible
                (but not proved logically) connections between ideal and physical
                phenomena. Instead of
     <i> objective </i> test (a row of consistent
                measurements) we are forced to use
     <i> subjective </i> tests,
                which ultimately are merely
     <i> the opinions </i> . </li> </ul>

      programs" height="30" src="images/alife.gif" title="program, 200kb - a butterfly and a flower" width="43">
      Program (tmpbrain.zip), </a>
     <a href="files/synt-2003-09.zip">
      Code (synt.zip) </a>
     <br> The idea of this program is explained in the article
     <a href="mind/consciousness-en.html" title="How did feeling and
      awareness emerge in nature">
      Mechanism of Consciousness. </a>
     The butterfly gets a
     <i> conditional reflex </i> after many tries
                of moving in different directions and occasional touching a flower.
                An
     <i> orientation in space </i> develops in the butterfly, too. </li> </ul>

      time might appear from empty nothingness">
      Origination of space </a>
     <br> A search of mechanism of physical existence. I'm trying
                to understand the mechanism of existence in general, origination
                of space, time and matter. Why and how existence is possible in
                principle? </li> </ul>
   <ul> <li> <a href="world/existence-en.html">
      Why is existence possible? </a>
     <br> Why does anything exist at all? I show a short explaining
                chain about initial reason of physical existence from a self-supported
                object to our
     <i> self-supported </i> universe. </li> </ul>
