   <h2> Consciousness and Logic </h2>

   <h4> <a title="author">

   <p> Suppose in a shop you've seen a home robot-servant. In the
            user instruction you read the robot has sensations and emotions,
            so it may possess consciousness. How could you make certain of
            it? </p>

   <p> I don't mean intellect or rational behavior. I say about first
            signs of consciousness - subjective sensations, feeling. A robot
            may properly (correctly, rationally, well) polish floor or wash
            dishes and the very this time it might experience absolutely no
            senses. </p>

   <p> Perhaps, live communication with the robot will help you to
            understand who the robot is - </p>

   <h4> A feeling person or a soulless machine? </h4>

   <p> Under the impression of such a difficult problem you purchase
            this "robot-servant" not only as a servant, mostly for
            solving the puzzle of consciousness - does the machine really
            possess consciousness like humans do? </p>

   <p> Setting up different units and programs makes the robot coming
            alive. Initially it looks like an awkward machine. Then it shows
            some abilities in housekeeping. It gets acquainted with you and
            your family. It begins to participate in your everyday works.
            Sometimes you watch TV news together and discuss them with your
            robot-servant. </p>

   <p> Your relationship comes quite unofficial, and you ask him
            a direct question about his consciousness. He says that he is
            feeling like you are, feels pain, wishes, loves the nature. It
            happens he is interested not only with cleaning of rooms; it is
            interesting to speak with him. </p>

   <p> You don't know how the robot is made. He is also interested
            with this question. You choose to communicate more to determine
            is it right that the science has created a feeling artificial
            entity, or it is only a sophisticated imitation of such entity. </p>

   <p> In a short time you become good friends. You discuss philosophical
            problems and political news, go fishing, and play chess with alternative
            success. </p>

   <p> At last you understand that your friend doesn't imitate conscious
            behavior. It is possible to simulate stupidity not capacitive
            mind. </p>

   <p> You both are peer intellectually. Nobody could forecast and
            program all future situations in the robot's life. Sometimes in
            new or hard circumstances the robot finds surprisingly good new
            solutions. You understand him well and sympathize with him. You
            see what is pleasant to him, what he is trying to avoid. He has
            wishes, needs, and interests. Now you are sure that a soulless
            machine would be unable to appear such a sincere friendship. </p>

   <p> After some years of this uncommon friendship you occasionally
            find a little mark "Windows compatible" on the back
            of you robot-friend. So you conclude the truth is somewhere in
            the Microsoft Empire. There you discover a laboratory of artificial
            intellect. They explain you that a computer cannot possess feelings
            or consciousness. The problem of artificial consciousness has
            not solved yet. All these ten years they controlled your robot-friend
            by radio. They claim you spent your feels and years for a "friendship"
            with a machinery! You refuse to believe that your friend is merely
            a serial robot-servant, a mechanism, not a sensing entity! </p>

   <p> You pass on the entire story to your robot-friend. He is also
            feeling deceived - his will was controlled by unknown persons!
            Despairingly he wills to die and cuts his stomach. You see wheels,
            pipes, wires, microcircuits. What does it say about? </p>

   <p> Maybe the Microsoft's programmers laughed on you? And your
            friend did actually think, feel, love you without an external
            control. </p>

   <p> --- </p>

   <p> Why not use an objective (scientific, experimental) way instead
            of my personal opinion about actual personality of this robot-servant? </p>

   <p> It may seem a good idea to check this robot's possible consciousness
            by more scientific test. However constructive (objective) definition
            of consciousness is impossible because personal spaces of subjective
            experiences are not linked by subjective (ideal) channels. They
            are linked through material channels that result "one cannot
            sense senses of others". Material and ideal processes are
            not intersecting, not reducing to each other. So "objective"
            test on consciousness is also impossible. In a better case some
            indirect measurements are possible, which may show some plausible
            (but not proved logically) connections between ideal and physical
            phenomena. Such "proves and testes" on possessing of
            consciousness are proposed in my article "
    <a href="consciousness-en.html">
     Mechanisms of consciousness </a>
    ". Instead of
    <i> objective </i> test (a row of consistent
            measurements) we are forced to use a subjective test. </p>

   <p> Subjective prove of consciousness is not logical but only
    <i> convincing </i> one. Our
    <i> formal </i> logic is ultimately
            supported only on our experience, too. So logical proof of consciousness
            reduces to a vicious circle and is not quite logical one. The
            logic has limits. In other words we can prove that some entity
            is conscious not strictly, but with the same accuracy as we believe
            that humans are conscious. Proof of consciousness should be supported
            on
    <i> convincing </i> reasoning directed as to mind as to heart. </p>

   <p> Also our burden is convincing a tester that some results of
            a specific testbed are evidence that the tested object possesses
            consciousness. It is not very difficult to "convince"
            a low educated person. Many accept a computer simulated psychiatrist
            Eliza as a rational, clever or even sensing computer. Many are
            ready to believe that Deep Blue "had the aim" to win
            Kasparov. A participant of comp.ai.philosophy made a conclusion
            that a scorpion "was trying to bite itself" when it
            was poured with hot wax. </p>

   <p> Our proof should be convincing for an educated and skeptical
            expert. Even if we could build the proof it remains not strict
            logically. Formal logic axioms are supported only on
    <i> experience </i> and
    <i> common sense </i> . Many sure facts cannot be strictly
            proved. For instance, you are sure that tomorrow the Sun will
            rise like it does for millions years. As an explanation you might
            use scientific evidence about the Solar system and laws of mechanics.
            However - we create
    <i> Lows of Nature </i> . They are not strict
            logical corollaries from observations. They are axiomatic claims
            about the most general repeated patterns of nature and logical
            corollaries from such claims. If tomorrow the Sun will not rise,
            the surprising fact is stronger than all our theories. The fact
            will force us to search new explanation. </p>

   <p> So the problem of our robot's consciousness remains in a domain
            of one's opinion. Happily my opinion about my consciousness is
            my consciousness per se; The robot's opinion about his consciousness
            proves (to him) that he is conscious. But my opinion about him
            remains a working hypothesis (a theory) like the theory explaining
            why our sun rises. </p>
